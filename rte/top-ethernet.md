# Realizartion on Top of Ethernet

This realization creates a separation between the real-time and the non-real-time traffic, enabling the former to bypass the DLL and reach Ethernet, thus prioritizing real-time traffic.

The most important thing we must notice is the absence of any alteration of the Ethernet hardware. However this architecture requires some changes to be performed at Application and DLL levels.

**Pros**

- No hardware modification.
- Modifications in the protocol stack are not massive.
- Better time-critial traffic handling.

**Cons**

- Due to requirements on delivery time, it is necessary to apply a dimensioning effort in order to calculate the number of switches in the network.

## Ethernet encapsulation
In order to avoid altering the hardware of devices, the use of Ethernet with a different stacked protocol on top of it is possible by means of the [EtherType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EtherType) field in the Ethernet frame.

**Important** Remember that in case of non-real-time traffic the Ethernet layer will encapsulate a TCP/IP or UDP/IP packet. In case of real-time traffic though, the encapsulated packet will belong to a different protocol.

The _EtherType_ field helps us in making sure two different higher protocols can be used for transmissions.

### Field definition
This 2-byte field is defined in [Ethernet II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame#Ethernet_II) frames (the most commonly used today) and is utilized to specify which upper-layer protocol is used and will, therefore, be encapsulated into the Ethernet frame.

The standard value for _EtherType_ is `0x0800` which identifies the [IP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol). Since realizations with this architecture might have their own stack in upper layers, the value in this field is very important. Every CP defines a specific value for field _EtherType_.

#### Enthernet II vs IEEE 802.3
It is important to note a difference in 2 protocols:

- [IEEE 802.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3) is the Ethernet protocol standardized by IEEE.
- [Ethernet II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame#Ethernet_II) is an evolution of Ethernet and is defined in [RFC 894](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc894) and makes changes in the Ethernet protocol in order to optimize the encapsulation of IP packets.

[This question](https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/5300/what-is-the-difference-between-ethernet-ii-and-802-3-ethernet) provides a good description of this difference.

#### Ambiguity in field semantics
The _EtherType_ field is present both in IEEE 802.3 and Ethernet II frames, however its meaning is totally different in those 2 frame types.

- In IEEE 802.3, the field indicates the length of the payload in bytes.
- In Ethernet II, the field indicates which protocol in upper layers is encapsulated in the frame.

In order to have both IEEE 802.3 and Ethernet II devices cohexist and communicate in the same network, it is necessary to solve the ambiguity being generated by this field. A solution was found by considring that IEEE 802.3 frames can have a max data length of 1500 bytes (`0x05DC`); RFC 894 forces the _EtherType_ field to have values higher than `0x0600` (1536), thus the following applies when a frame is received:

1. If the data length is higher than 1500 bytes, then the frame must be an Ethernet II frame and the field being read is actually the upper protocol identifier.
2. Otherwise, if the data length is lower or equal to 1500 bytes, then the frame is an IEEE 802.3 frame and the field being read indicates the payload length.

## Case study
One of the most common CP implementing this realization is [Ethernet PowerLink](epl.md).
