# Profinet IO

The [Profinet IO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROFINET) protocol appears in CPs 3/4, 3/5 and 3/6 in the the CPF-3 definet in IEC 61784-2. It is vastly used by many manufacturers and supports highly time-critical applications with strict constraints on delivery time and jitter.

**Class** Profinet IO fulfills the requirements for [Class 3](pi.md#motion-control-class) in IEC 61784.
