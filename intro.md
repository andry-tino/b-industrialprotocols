# First Chapter

In manufacturing environments and industrial automation contexts, it is not possible to make use of the same office-oriented networking systems as time criticality is not taken into consideration by those protocols.

In order to cope with those limitations, the world of Industrial Automation and Engineering has come up with different solutions. Today, industrial environments deploy Real Time Networks and protocols targeting time critical applications.

## Under analysis
We will investigate more regarding these technologies:

1. [Real Time Ethernet](rte/intro.md)
2. [Automotive](automotive/intro.md)
3. [Other](other/intro.md)
